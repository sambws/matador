DONE:
-movement
-collision
-npc base
-npc actual code
-text system
	-> text box
- cutscene things (barebones, no animation for the characters)
- make it so that the "talked" variable for npcs is replaced by an integer value so you can have multiple conversations other than the two

TODO:
- find a better way to load in levels besides massive functions/walls of code (look at the cowboy game)

CLEANUP:
-maybe combine the talking/cutscene var for cleaner/easier code
-more packages
